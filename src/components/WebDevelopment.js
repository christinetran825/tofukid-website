        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p>What can I say, it's hard to separate the designer from the developer.  While keeping up with my curiousity for human centered interactions, I craft products that delight people. When building things, I like to be product minded while keeping the end-user in mind. I see the technical details and end goal because people will use what I build. So, I treat all web development products as if they were interactive illustrative artworks.</p>
