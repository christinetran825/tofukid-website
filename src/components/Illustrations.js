        <h4>Thank You, Teachers</h4>
        <p>In honor of Teacher's Day, I've drawn a series of portraits of the teachers who inspired me in many ways throughout my education. Check out my Tumblr <a href="http://thanksforteachers.tumblr.com/" target="blank">"thanksforteacher"</a> to view more portraits.</p>
        <p>Pictures Here</p>

        <h4>Taco Time</h4>
        <p>Who doesn't like tacos? These digital art posters were made for an imaginary taco brand. Each poster has a pattern showing foods and objects related to tacos like chilies, hot sauce, sombreros.</p>
