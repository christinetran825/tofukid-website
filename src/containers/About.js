        <p>As a UX designer, I’m inspired to make the familiar strange and the strange familiar by finding the balance between scientist, psychologist, sociologist, and artists (among others). I focus on the practicality and functionality of the design process and how to channel a users’ needs. It goes beyond crafting an aesthetically pleasing product. To feel and experience the gratitude and appreciation of people’s delight through making culture, not just consuming it fuels me.<br/><br/>
        With a background in programming, I work with other developers as a designer with programming literacy to make the process seamless. I admire the structures and pieces that make things whole through a childlike awe. Wondering, and making connections satisfies my need to see how a story ends. I enjoy seeing the bigger picture while anticipating and imagining in detail what tomorrow could or should be.</p>
